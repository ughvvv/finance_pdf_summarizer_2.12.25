      "raw_text": "# MARKET OVERVIEW\n\nThe global financial markets experienced a dynamic week ending January 31, 2025, characterized by significant central bank activities, geopolitical developments, and shifting investor sentiments.\n\n**Monetary Policy Dynamics:**\n\n- **Federal Reserve Stance:** Federal Reserve Chair **Jerome Powell** reaffirmed a cautious approach to monetary policy, indicating no immediate plans for interest rate cuts in 2025. Emphasizing a focus on real economic activity, particularly employment, Powell projected that **real growth is expected to exceed the trend rate of 3%** this year. This robust growth outlook may influence inflation rates and lead markets to anticipate potential interest rate hikes in **early 2026**.\n\n- **European Central Bank Actions:** The **European Central Bank (ECB)** cut rates by **25 basis points (bps)** to **2.75%**, signaling ongoing monetary easing amid concerns over growth and persistent inflation. The ECB perceives the \"neutral\" rate to be below **2%**, with expectations for further cuts as **Eurozone GDP growth stagnated at 0%** in Q4 2024.\n\n**Market Sentiment and Trends:**\n\n- **Impact of AI Developments:** The market was notably influenced by discussions surrounding **DeepSeek's** impact on the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The tech-heavy **NASDAQ** and semiconductor index (**SOX**) experienced volatility, with the SOX recording its largest one-day relative decline in over **20 years**, and the largest global company losing **17%** in market capitalization on January 27.\n\n- **Shift in Investor Behavior:** Despite the tech sector's turbulence, **68%** of S&P 500 stocks rose on the same day, indicating a broader market resilience. Retail investors exhibited strong buying activity amid the dip, with average retail inflows reaching **$1.3 billion per day**, the highest since November's post-U.S. presidential election period.\n\n**Critical Data Points:**\n\n- **U.S. Treasury Yields:** The **10-year Treasury yield** declined by nearly **10 basis points**, settling around **4.54%**, reflecting changing expectations regarding inflation and growth.\n\n- **Volatility Indices:** The **VIX index** relaxed throughout the week, signaling reduced market volatility, while the **VIX call skew** reached its steepest levels since the Global Financial Crisis, indicating heightened demand for downside protection.\n\n- **Commodity Prices:** **Gold** approached all-time highs, breaking through key resistance levels to trade around **$2,790** per ounce, driven by central bank accumulations and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n# REGIONAL/SECTOR METRICS\n\n### United States\n\n| **Indicator**                    | **Value**       | **Context**                                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Fed Policy Rate**              | Unchanged       | Stable economic outlook with focus on employment              |\n| **Q4 GDP Growth**                | 2.3%            | Reflects economic performance in Q4 2024                      |\n| **Inflation Projection (QoQ)**   | 2.7%            | Slightly higher than previous estimates                       |\n| **Weekly Jobless Claims**        | 225k            | Slight increase from previous week's 223k                     |\n| **S&P 500 Weekly Change**        | -1%             | Indicating a challenging week for equities                    |\n| **NASDAQ Weekly Change**         | -1.4%           | Tech stocks faced downward pressure                           |\n| **10-Year Treasury Yield**       | 4.54%           | Increased by 7bps, signaling rising borrowing costs           |\n\n### Europe\n\n| **Indicator**                    | **Value**       | **Context**                                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **ECB Policy Rate**              | 2.75%           | Cut by 25bps to support economic growth                       |\n| **Eurozone GDP Growth (Q4)**     | 0%              | Stagnation, prompting monetary easing                         |\n| **Eurozone Core Inflation**      | 6%              | Elevated, but leading indicators suggest moderation           |\n| **Germany CPI YoY**              | 2.3%            | Based on state-level CPIs                                     |\n| **EuroStoxx YTD Performance**    | +8%             | Outperforming U.S. indices                                    |\n| **DAX YTD Performance**          | +9%             | Strong start to the year                                      |\n| **Stoxx 600 EPS Growth**         | Rising          | Indicates improving corporate earnings                        |\n\n### Asia\n\n| **Indicator**                          | **Value**       | **Context**                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **BoJ Policy Rate**                    | Raised          | Continued tightening as per Governor Himino                   |\n| **JPY Exchange Rate**                  | Strengthened    | JPY appreciated against major currencies                      |\n| **Nikkei Index Performance**           | Rebound         | Continued recovery amid optimistic economic signals           |\n| **China Caixin Manufacturing PMI**     | Not Provided    | Awaiting data, key for assessing economic activity            |\n| **South Korea Trade Balance (Jan)**    | Not Provided    | Crucial for evaluating economic health                        |\n\n# HIGHLIGHTED OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## Mainstream Picks (Strong Fundamentals)\n\n### **Apple Inc.

        "market_overview": "The global financial markets experienced a dynamic week ending January 31, 2025, characterized by significant central bank activities, geopolitical developments, and shifting investor sentiments.\n\n**Monetary Policy Dynamics:**\n\n- **Federal Reserve Stance:** Federal Reserve Chair **Jerome Powell** reaffirmed a cautious approach to monetary policy, indicating no immediate plans for interest rate cuts in 2025. Emphasizing a focus on real economic activity, particularly employment, Powell projected that **real growth is expected to exceed the trend rate of 3%** this year. This robust growth outlook may influence inflation rates and lead markets to anticipate potential interest rate hikes in **early 2026**.\n\n- **European Central Bank Actions:** The **European Central Bank (ECB)** cut rates by **25 basis points (bps)** to **2.75%**, signaling ongoing monetary easing amid concerns over growth and persistent inflation. The ECB perceives the \"neutral\" rate to be below **2%**, with expectations for further cuts as **Eurozone GDP growth stagnated at 0%** in Q4 2024.\n\n**Market Sentiment and Trends:**\n\n- **Impact of AI Developments:** The market was notably influenced by discussions surrounding **DeepSeek's** impact on the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The tech-heavy **NASDAQ** and semiconductor index (**SOX**) experienced volatility, with the SOX recording its largest one-day relative decline in over **20 years**, and the largest global company losing **17%** in market capitalization on January 27.\n\n- **Shift in Investor Behavior:** Despite the tech sector's turbulence, **68%** of S&P 500 stocks rose on the same day, indicating a broader market resilience. Retail investors exhibited strong buying activity amid the dip, with average retail inflows reaching **$1.3 billion per day**, the highest since November's post-U.S. presidential election period.\n\n**Critical Data Points:**\n\n- **U.S. Treasury Yields:** The **10-year Treasury yield** declined by nearly **10 basis points**, settling around **4.54%**, reflecting changing expectations regarding inflation and growth.\n\n- **Volatility Indices:** The **VIX index** relaxed throughout the week, signaling reduced market volatility, while the **VIX call skew** reached its steepest levels since the Global Financial Crisis, indicating heightened demand for downside protection.\n\n- **Commodity Prices:** **Gold** approached all-time highs, breaking through key resistance levels to trade around **$2,790** per ounce, driven by central bank accumulations and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n# REGIONAL/SECTOR METRICS\n\n### United States\n\n| **Indicator**                    | **Value**       | **Context**                                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Fed Policy Rate**              | Unchanged       | Stable economic outlook with focus on employment              |\n| **Q4 GDP Growth**                | 2.3%            | Reflects economic performance in Q4 2024                      |\n| **Inflation Projection (QoQ)**   | 2.7%            | Slightly higher than previous estimates                       |\n| **Weekly Jobless Claims**        | 225k            | Slight increase from previous week's 223k                     |\n| **S&P 500 Weekly Change**        | -1%             | Indicating a challenging week for equities                    |\n| **NASDAQ Weekly Change**         | -1.4%           | Tech stocks faced downward pressure                           |\n| **10-Year Treasury Yield**       | 4.54%           | Increased by 7bps, signaling rising borrowing costs           |\n\n### Europe\n\n| **Indicator**                    | **Value**       | **Context**                                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **ECB Policy Rate**              | 2.75%           | Cut by 25bps to support economic growth                       |\n| **Eurozone GDP Growth (Q4)**     | 0%              | Stagnation, prompting monetary easing                         |\n| **Eurozone Core Inflation**      | 6%              | Elevated, but leading indicators suggest moderation           |\n| **Germany CPI YoY**              | 2.3%            | Based on state-level CPIs                                     |\n| **EuroStoxx YTD Performance**    | +8%             | Outperforming U.S. indices                                    |\n| **DAX YTD Performance**          | +9%             | Strong start to the year                                      |\n| **Stoxx 600 EPS Growth**         | Rising          | Indicates improving corporate earnings                        |\n\n### Asia\n\n| **Indicator**                          | **Value**       | **Context**                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **BoJ Policy Rate**                    | Raised          | Continued tightening as per Governor Himino                   |\n| **JPY Exchange Rate**                  | Strengthened    | JPY appreciated against major currencies                      |\n| **Nikkei Index Performance**           | Rebound         | Continued recovery amid optimistic economic signals           |\n| **China Caixin Manufacturing PMI**     | Not Provided    | Awaiting data, key for assessing economic activity            |\n| **South Korea Trade Balance (Jan)**    | Not Provided    | Crucial for evaluating economic health                        |\n\n# HIGHLIGHTED OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## Mainstream Picks (Strong Fundamentals)\n\n### **Apple Inc.
